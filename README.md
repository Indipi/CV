To Whom It May Concern

I have recently completed my Engineering PhD at the University of Canterbury during which I designed and built an exoskeleton using electomechanical actuation in conjunction with Functional Electrical Stimulation to improve stroke rehabilitation. During my PhD project I spent a lot of time developing my skills in electronics, modelling, controls, embedded systems, and software. I would like to continue to pursue a career in the medical technologies field particulary in research role.

I am a creative and enthusiastic person who gets on well with others. I enjoy problem solving and have a persistently optimistic attitude when faced with challenges. In my spare time I am a jack of all trades master of several type of person who likes to keep busy with a large variety of projects and hobbies such as programming, creative writing, rock climbing. If I am ever lacking specific skills required for something new it never takes me long to pick them up.

In this repository you will find my CV which contains more detail about my skills, experience and education. I am happy to answer any questions you have or to meet/skype with you to discuss further.

Yours sincerely 


Ashley Stewart
